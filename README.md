# üí´ About Me:

üë®‚Äçüíª I'm an AI engineer with a strong background in machine learning and deep learning, specializing in computer vision. I have a passion for developing intelligent systems that can perceive and understand visual data.

üíº With nearly 2 years of real-world experience, I have worked extensively on various computer vision projects, leveraging state-of-the-art techniques and frameworks. My expertise lies in developing and deploying machine learning models for object detection, image segmentation, and image classification tasks.

üî¨ I have a solid understanding of classical computer vision algorithms as well as hands-on experience with modern deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. I am well-versed in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and generative adversarial networks (GANs).

üåü I thrive in collaborative environments and have worked with cross-functional teams to deliver end-to-end AI solutions. I am experienced in preprocessing and augmenting large-scale image datasets, training deep learning models, and optimizing their performance for production deployment.

üöÄ I'm always excited to take on new challenges and contribute to cutting-edge projects that push the boundaries of AI in computer vision. Feel free to explore my GitHub repositories to see some of my work and projects.
